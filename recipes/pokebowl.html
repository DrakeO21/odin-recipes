    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Following the theme of hawaiian cuisine, the acai bowl is a creation of blended acai berries, 
        granola, and an assortment of toppings, with a sweet drizzle to top it off.</p> <p>I would say these sweet bowls are best enjoyed on a summer day, 
        laying at the beach but they can be enjoyed throughout the entire year, no matter the weather.</p>
